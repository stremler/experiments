TODO

 - empty strings should sort last, not first.
 - handle ascending and descending sorting
 - add in a filter mechanism, something like looking for files like
   filters/<columnname>
   and loading/invoking them?
   Any better methods?
 - add some basic useful error handling

 - Add anchors at jump changes
 - Put a 'jump to' list at the top and bottom

 - consider pulling in the XML and timestamp, then
   storing the data in an sqlite3 database, and
   reloading when the XML file timestamp changes.
